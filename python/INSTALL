## Installation of `aff` as a python library

To install the library, I suggest creating a new conda environment for it.

```bash
conda create -n affpy3 python=3.13
```

Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate affpy3
```

Build and install the aff-python extension from this directory ("../aff/python"):

```bash
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
```

Test the installation by running the `test.ipynb` notebook.
